# Pong Game with MAUI

## Overview

This project is a recreation of the classic Pong game using .NET MAUI for the front-end. The project demonstrates the use of the Redux design pattern using Fluxor.

## Features

- Cross-platform UI with .NET MAUI
- State management using Fluxor (Redux design pattern)
- Modular and scalable architecture

## Project Structure

- **MauiPong**: The MAUI front-end application.

## Redux Design Pattern using Fluxor

This project uses the Fluxor library to implement the Redux design pattern in the MAUI application. Fluxor provides a unidirectional data flow and centralized state management, making it easier to manage and debug the application state.

### Key Components

- **Actions**: Define the events that can change the state.
- **Reducers**: Handle actions and update the state accordingly.
- **State**: The single source of truth for the application state.
- **Effects**: Handle side-effects such as API calls and dispatch actions based on the results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Set the `MauiPong` project as the startup project and run it.
